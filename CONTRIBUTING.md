feat(discord): Add Korean language support

- Add ko.json translation file
- Update language selector with Korean option
- Test all commands with Korean locale

Closes #123
```

## Translation Guidelines

Translations are crucial for our multi-platform approach:

1. **Consistency**: Use same translations across all platforms
2. **Structure**: Maintain JSON structure from English files
3. **Placeholders**: Keep variables like `{username}` unchanged
4. **Context**: Consider platform-specific terminology
5. **Testing**: Verify on actual platform

### Adding a New Language

1. Create translation files in all platforms:
   - `/packages/bots/discord/*/locales/<lang>.json`
   - `/packages/bots/telegram/*/locales/<lang>.json`
   - `/packages/shared/locales/<lang>.json`

2. Update language selectors in each platform

3. Test thoroughly on each platform

## Testing

### Unit Tests
- Test business logic independently
- Mock external dependencies
- Aim for 80% coverage

### Integration Tests
- Test platform-specific features
- Verify database operations
- Check API integrations

### Platform Testing
- **Discord**: Test with different server permissions
- **Telegram**: Test in groups and private chats
- **API**: Test rate limiting and authentication

## Contributing New Platforms

1. **Propose the platform**: Open an issue explaining:
   - Why this platform is valuable
   - User base in WhiteOut Survival community
   - Technical feasibility
   - Maintenance commitment

2. **Design the architecture**:
   - Follow existing bot structure
   - Reuse shared components
   - Plan for localization

3. **Implement core features**:
   - User verification
   - Alliance management
   - Event scheduling
   - Multi-language support

4. **Documentation**:
   - Setup instructions
   - Platform-specific features
   - API documentation

## Pull Request Process

1. **Ensure compatibility**: Changes shouldn't break other platforms
2. **Update documentation**: README, API docs, inline comments
3. **Add tests**: Unit and integration tests
4. **Pass CI/CD**: All checks must pass
5. **Request review**: From platform maintainers

### Review Criteria
